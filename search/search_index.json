I'm excited to have you here. I'd like to take a moment to introduce myself and share a bit about my journey.</p> <p>First off, I proudly wore the University of Southern California Trojans jersey and spent over a decade as a professional baseball player. Those years were filled with incredible moments, lasting friendships, and lessons that shaped who I am today. But life is all about chapters, and after a successful baseball career, I found myself pondering what would come next.  I did have a degree from USC in Policy, Planning, and Development, but I wasn't conviced it was what I wanted to do after baseball.</p> <p></p> <p>Back in 2008, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim drafted me from USC. The first years as a professional baseball player, the baseball field was my main stage, but the off-season was a different story. It wasn't easy to find work during those months, but I embraced the challenge. I learned that real accomplishments don't come without hurdles, and I was determined to overcome them.</p> <p>Fast forward through 13 amazing years in baseball, and a truly magical thing occurred. My childhood friend, who also happened to be my childhood crush, reentered my life. With her unwavering support and motivation, I made a life-altering decision to pursue my passion for technology.  For the last three years of my professional baseball career, I enrolled back to school and, through online classes, attained my second Bachelor's degree.</p> <p></p> <p>Imagine this: while my teammates celebrated after games and partied, I remained committed to my studies. Those late nights on the team bus became opportunities for deep dives into my education. I traded instant gratification for the promise of long-term success. The journey demanded everything I had, pushing me physically and mentally. But I assure you, every ounce of effort was worth it.</p> <p></p> <p>Now armed with a second Bachelor\u2019s degree in Information Technology, I've transitioned seamlessly from baseball to the world of IT. I've earned certifications like CompTIA Network+, Security+, and the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), which have further honed my expertise.</p> <p>While I might be relatively new to the IT scene, the energy and discipline I cultivated during my baseball years have fueled my thirst for knowledge. More than personal growth, my passion lies in making a positive impact on others.</p> <p>Through this blog, I'm excited to share valuable insights, personal stories, and practical tips to help you navigate the world of technology and achieve your career goals. Join me as we venture into this exciting realm together.</p> <p>Thank you for dropping by, and I hope my content inspires and enlightens you. Here's to growth and new beginnings!</p>"},{"location":"Certifications/","title":"Certifications","text":"Issuer - Certification Issued Cisco - CCNA September 11, 2022 CompTIA Network+ February 16, 2022 CompTIA Security+ October 12, 2021"},{"location":"Certifications/CompTIA%20Security%2B/","title":"CompTIA Security+","text":"<p>This was the first certification that I attained in my IT career.

For example, if trying to get the file hash or <code>write.exe</code>, navigate to the directory where the file is located from Powershell and type:</p> <pre><code>Get-FileHash .\\write.exe\n</code></pre> <p>If you're trying to get every hash value of the files within a directory, you can use the <code>*</code> wildcard in the path parameter, like so:</p> <pre><code>Get-FileHash .\\*.exe\n</code></pre> <p>By default, Windows will generate the hash value using the <code>SHA256</code> hashing algorithm, but you can specify which algorithm to use with the <code>-Algorithm</code> or <code>-a</code> options. </p> <pre><code>Get-FileHash 'C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe' -Algorithm SHA384\n</code></pre> <p>Now, for attackers, the method of modifying a hash value is trivial, as you will see in this example.  Here's the MD5 hash value of a file, and for easier viewing, I've piped it to <code>Format-List</code> so it lists the result in a list format. </p> <pre><code>PS C:\\Test&gt; Get-FileHash .\\SomeFile.txt -Algorithm MD5 | Format-List\n\nAlgorithm : MD5\nHash      : 4298DF4E98CF0FEED4F511F8E67DC0EB\nPath      : C:\\Test\\SomeFile.txt\n</code></pre> <p>Using the <code>AppendToHash</code> text and using the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator, we redirect the text and append it to the output of the original file. Afterward, we get the MD5 hash value once again and notice we get an entirely different value. </p> <pre><code>PS C:\\Test&gt; echo \"AppendToHash\" &gt;&gt; .\\SomeFile.txt\nPS C:\\Test&gt; Get-FileHash .\\SomeFile.txt -Algorithm MD5 | Format-List\n\nAlgorithm : MD5\nHash      : 0F1DD50C559BCE6F35791F9E6495599D\nPath      : C:\\Test\\SomeFile.txt\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"My%20Learning/TryHackMe/Learning%20Paths/SOC%201/Cyber%20Defense%20Frameworks/Pyramid%20of%20Pain/#ip-address-easy","title":"IP Address (Easy)","text":"<ul> <li>Zone: Green (easy)</li> <li>IP Address: Identifies devices on a network like desktops, servers, and cameras.</li> <li>Sending and Receiving Data: IP addresses are essential for transmitting data over a network.</li> <li>Pyramid of Pain: IP addresses are a green-level indicator, indicating their significance.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"My%20Learning/TryHackMe/Learning%20Paths/SOC%201/Cyber%20Defense%20Frameworks/Pyramid%20of%20Pain/#defense-perspective","title":"Defense Perspective","text":"<ul> <li>Blocking IP Addresses: A common defense tactic to prevent incoming requests from certain IPs.</li> <li>Limitations: This tactic isn't foolproof; experienced adversaries can easily switch to new IPs.</li> <li>Challenge - Fast Flux: Adversaries use techniques like Fast Flux to evade IP blocking.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"My%20Learning/TryHackMe/Learning%20Paths/SOC%201/Cyber%20Defense%20Frameworks/Pyramid%20of%20Pain/#fast-flux-technique","title":"Fast Flux Technique","text":"<ul> <li>DNS Technique: Used by botnets to hide malicious activities behind compromised hosts.</li> <li>Purpose: Concealing communication between malware and its command server.</li> <li>Dynamic IP Association: Multiple changing IPs associated with a domain name.</li> <li>Akamai's Definition: Fast Flux makes malware communication hard to detect.</li> <li>Example: Palo Alto's fictional scenario explains Fast Flux's resilience.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"My%20Learning/TryHackMe/Learning%20Paths/SOC%201/Cyber%20Defense%20Frameworks/Pyramid%20of%20Pain/#domain-names-simple","title":"Domain Names (Simple)","text":"<p>Zone: Teal (Simple)</p> <p>This section talks about the significance of domain names in the context of cybersecurity.
