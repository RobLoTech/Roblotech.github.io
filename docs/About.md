# About me

Welcome to github repository! As a former USC Trojan and professional baseball player, I’ve made an exciting transition into the world of IT, and I’m thrilled to share my journey with you.

Baseball has been a significant part of my life, bringing friendships, life lessons, and unforgettable moments. But after my successful career, I began to contemplate my next steps.

Drafted by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2008, I balanced financial stability during the off-season. However, finding work in those limited months wasn’t easy. Nevertheless, I persevered, knowing that worthwhile achievements come with challenges.

Time flew, and after 13 amazing years in baseball, something truly magical happened. My long-time childhood friend, and let’s be honest, my childhood crush, came back into my life. We reignited our incredible bond, and with her unwavering support and motivation, I decided to follow my passion for technology.

Picture this: while teammates celebrated at parties, I remained disciplined, prioritizing my studies. Late nights on the team bus became opportunities to dive deep into education, sacrificing immediate gratification for long-term success. The journey was demanding, pushing me to the limits both physically and mentally. But let me assure you, every ounce of effort was worth it.

Now armed with a second Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology, I’ve seamlessly transitioned from baseball to the world of IT. Certifications like CompTIA Network+, Security+, and the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) have furthered my expertise.

Although I’m relatively new to the IT scene, the energy and discipline I cultivated during my baseball years have propelled my thirst for knowledge. Beyond personal growth, my passion has been and always will lie in making a positive impact on others.

Through this blog, I’ll share valuable insights, personal anecdotes, and practical tips to help you navigate the world of technology and career growth. Join me as we explore this exciting realm together.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find inspiration and enlightenment in my content!
