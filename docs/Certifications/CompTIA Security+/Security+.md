# CompTIA Security+

This was the first certification that I attained in my IT career.  Having little experience in the field, I told myself I wanted to pass this certification as it would propel my passion for cybersecurity.  I did do a lot of research beforehand because when it comes to IT, looking at a starting point, or the general overview of where you'd want to go in your career can be a daunting dask as well as overwhelming.  

From early research, I found that it was one of the best entry level certifications when it comes to those trying to get into cybersecurity.  As opposed to more intermediate or advanced certifications, like the [CISSP - Certified Information Systems Security Professional](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp/cissp-experience-requirements) which require at least **5 years** of experience in order to take the exam, the CompTIA Security+ simply ***recommends*** 2 years of experience, but no prior experience is required.

## How To Prepare

Before you take on this challenge, it is best to understand what you'll be getting yourself into.  Even though it might seem unattainable without experience, it is totally possible for anyone motivated, disciplined, and with good study habits.  I will share what worked for me.  However, not everyone learns or understands information the same way.  I'm more of a visual learner; meaning I like to visualize concepts in order for them to stick.  Others retain information better through books.  I used a combination of both methods as I found it valuable to understand concepts through different teaching methods, or instructors.
