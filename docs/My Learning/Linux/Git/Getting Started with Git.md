T## Getting Started with Git


## Creating Your Identity

In order to add files, commit changes, and push files to your repository, you first need to identify as a user executing these changes. 
To do so, simply run:
```
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
This will set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
