# SOC Level 1

## Summary

As a Junior Security Analyst, and specifically as a Triage Specialist, you will focus on monitoring and managing potential security issues. This involves examining event logs and alerts to identify potential threats.

## Tasks
Your main tasks as a Junior Security Analyst (or Tier 1 SOC Analyst) will be:

- **Alert Monitoring and Investigation:** Your primary responsibility will be to keep an eye on alerts that signal possible security problems. This often takes place in a continuous 24/7 security operations center (SOC) environment. You'll investigate these alerts to determine if they indicate any real security threats.

- **Security Tool Configuration and Management:** You'll learn to set up and handle security tools. These tools help detect and respond to security issues effectively. Understanding how to configure and manage these tools is essential for maintaining a secure environment.

- **Development and Implementation of IDS Signatures:** You'll gain knowledge about creating and applying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) signatures. These signatures are like security patterns that help in recognizing specific types of cyber threats.

- **Escalation of Security Incidents:** If you come across alerts or incidents that seem more complex or severe, you'll be responsible for escalating them. This involves notifying higher-level experts like Tier 2 analysts or Team Leads who can take appropriate actions to address the situation.
