# SOC Level 1

## Summary

As a Junior Security Analyst, and specifically as a Triage Specialist, you will focus on monitoring and managing potential security issues. This involves examining event logs and alerts to identify potential threats.

## Tasks
Your main tasks as a Junior Security Analyst (or Tier 1 SOC Analyst) will be:

1. **Alert Monitoring and Investigation:** Your primary responsibility will be to keep an eye on alerts that signal possible security problems. This often takes place in a continuous 24/7 security operations center (SOC) environment. You'll investigate these alerts to determine if they indicate any real security threats.

2. **Security Tool Configuration and Management:** You'll learn to set up and handle security tools. These tools help detect and respond to security issues effectively. Understanding how to configure and manage these tools is essential for maintaining a secure environment.

3. **Development and Implementation of IDS Signatures:** You'll gain knowledge about creating and applying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) signatures. These signatures are like security patterns that help in recognizing specific types of cyber threats.

4. **Escalation of Security Incidents:** If you come across alerts or incidents that seem more complex or severe, you'll be responsible for escalating them. This involves notifying higher-level experts like Tier 2 analysts or Team Leads who can take appropriate actions to address the situation.

## Conclusion

This knowledge will serve as the foundation for understanding the concepts and tasks covered in the training.

By completing this learning path, you'll be better equipped to contribute effectively as a Junior Security Analyst, focusing on alert management and basic incident response. This understanding will not only support your personal notes for future reference but will also be valuable for individuals seeking to learn more about security operations.
