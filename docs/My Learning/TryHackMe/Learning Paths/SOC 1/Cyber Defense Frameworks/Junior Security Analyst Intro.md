# Role: Security Operations Analyst

This role involves overseeing and managing event logs and alerts to ensure the security of an organization's digital environment.

## Responsibilities:

- **Monitor and Investigate Alerts**: A significant part of the job involves keeping a constant watch on alerts, even around the clock in a 24x7 Security Operations Center (SOC). This means being vigilant for any signs of potential threats.

- **Configure and Manage Security Tools**: Security tools such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) need to be set up properly and maintained. These tools help identify potential breaches or malicious activities.

- **Develop and Implement Basic IDS Signatures**: To improve the effectiveness of IDS, you might create specific "signatures" or patterns that the system can look for to spot known attack methods.

- **Participate in SOC Working Groups and Meetings**: Collaboration is key. Being part of discussions and groups within the SOC helps ensure everyone is on the same page and can respond effectively.

- **Escalate Security Incidents**: If a situation goes beyond the initial assessment, you'll escalate it to more experienced colleagues for further investigation.

## Qualifications:

- **0-2 Years in Security Operations:** This role is often an entry-level position, suitable for those just starting in the field.
- **Basic Networking Knowledge:** Understanding how data moves through networks (OSI model) is essential for detecting anomalies.
- **Knowledge of Windows, Linux, Web Applications:** Familiarity with different operating systems and common web technologies helps recognize abnormal behavior.
- **Scripting/Programming Skills:** While not always required, having skills in scripting or programming can be a plus, especially for tasks like automating certain processes.


## Desired:

- **[CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security):** This is a well-regarded certification in the security field that covers foundational concepts.
- **Security Operation Center Three-Tier Model:** Understanding the three-tier model (junior, mid-level, and senior analysts) helps you know where you fit and where you can progress.

## Core Functions of SOC:

- **Investigate, Monitor, Prevent, and Respond to Threats (24x7):** The SOC's primary mission is to stay vigilant around the clock, analyzing incoming data for any signs of threats. This includes actively preventing breaches and quickly responding when they occur.

- **Protect Organizational Assets:** This encompasses safeguarding everything valuable to the organization, from sensitive data and business systems to the company's reputation.

## Preparation and Prevention:

- **Stay Informed:** Being aware of current cyber threats is crucial. You can use platforms like Twitter and [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/welcome) to stay up-to-date with the latest news and trends.

- **Security Roadmap:** Developing a strategic plan helps your organization be ready for worst-case scenarios. This involves a combination of technologies, policies, and procedures to mitigate risks.

## Prevention:

- **Gathering Intelligence Data:** Understanding the latest threats, who the threat actors are, and their methods (TTPs) assists in building effective defenses.

- **Update Signatures and Patch Vulnerabilities:** Keeping firewall signatures current and patching vulnerabilities prevents attackers from exploiting known weaknesses.

- **Application Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Managing lists of approved (whitelisted) and prohibited (blacklisted) applications, email addresses, and IPs helps control potential threats.

## Monitoring and Investigation:

- **Monitoring:** This proactive approach involves using specialized tools like [Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)](https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-siem) systems and [Endpoint Detection and Response(EDR)](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-endpoint-detection-and-response.html) systems to monitor network activities for suspicious patterns.

- **Investigation:** If an alert is triggered, it's important to understand the attack's methods and motives. Analyzing data logs and using open-source tools can help gain insights.

## A Day in the Life of a Junior Security Analyst:

**Before an Incident:**
Before any potential security incident occurs, your day starts by examining tickets and analyzing logs and alerts that have been generated.

**Incident Response:**

- **Duration:** Incident response can vary widely, taking hours, days, or even weeks to fully address.

- **Key Questions:** During an incident, you'll ask important questions: Was data taken? How much? Did the attacker move to other systems?

- **Stages:** Incident response typically follows three main stages:
  1. **Detection:** Identifying that a breach or attack has occurred.
  2. **Containment:** Isolating affected systems to prevent further damage.
  3. **Remediation:** Fixing the vulnerabilities and restoring normal operations.
