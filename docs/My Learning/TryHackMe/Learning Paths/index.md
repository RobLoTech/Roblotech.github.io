# About Learning Paths

Cybersecurity is always evolving and I believe there's no substitute for practical experience. That's where TryHackMe's Learning Paths come in â€” an exceptional resource for those eager to dive into the world of hacking and security, or for seasoned professionals looking to enhance their skills.

As someone who's not entirely new to this realm but seeks continuous expansion and growth, I find the Learning Paths to be an invaluable asset. They've been skillfully crafted to offer a balance between structured guidance and the freedom to explore and experiment. Each step is meticulously designed to ensure comprehension and retention, cultivating a profound understanding of the subject matter.

With the Learning Paths, they've created an environment where education is not confined to textbooks and lectures, but rather brought to life through hands-on engagement.

Whether you're a beginner, an intermediate learner, or an adept professional, Learning Paths are an open invitation to challenge yourself, learn by doing, and ultimately contribute to a safer digital landscape. These are my own personal notes I've gathered as I followed along the various lessons, and serve as future reference for myself or anyone looking to learn.
